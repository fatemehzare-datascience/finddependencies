The expected output of the program is a JSON file that shows all the work orders and their dependencies (based on orders and dependencies file)
Since the program will be used with different inputs, it takes files as command-line arguments.
The output file, which shows the dependencies and orders of the file in a JSON format, is created as output.json file.
To run the program type the following line in terminal:
"python finddependecies_code.py orders.txt dependencies.txt output.json"
